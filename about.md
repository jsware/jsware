## Me
<p class="message">
  I currently work for a bank in the UK, specifically working in the area of APIs and integration. I use a pragmatic blend of APIs, EDA, ESBs, REST, SOA, Web Services and more to connect and integrate systems. The contents of this site are entirely my own and do not represent the views or opinions of my employer.

## My Why

</p>

## This Site
This site uses the Hyde theme for the Jekyll static site generator with help from Poole. In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

* Uses [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com) theme and [Poole](https://github.com/poole);
* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com);
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com);
* Coded with [Atom](https://atom.io/), a hackable text editor for the 21st century.

Thanks for reading!
